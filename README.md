# TVTalksWithIbz
My first ever piece of coding using Visual Studio Code. Created a short blog talking about TV series. Hopefully, this will be the first of many.
I used YouTube and some notes I recorded to help me set up a visual studio file and using html and css. The website is very simple as it is my first time putting coding
into practice. I will aim to create more advanced websites and start to use forms and and eventually Javascript.
